# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Using extensive data on ride-sharing in various cities, this project produces a summary Dataframe of ride-sharing data. The data is split up by city type: rural, suburban, or urban. The summary contains breakdowns of the total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. Following this summary, a multiple-line graph was created to showcase the total weekly fares, divided by city type. 

## Results

The following table shows the summary of ride-share data based on city type. Urban cities saw the most amount of rides and drivers, resulting in the largest total fare amount. However, urban cities had the lowest average fares, averaging at $24.53 per ride and $16.57. This is a stark contrast to rural cities, which saw the highest average fares at $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver. Suburban fares sat between rural and urban but leaned toward the higher end.

The multiple-line chart of weekly fares by city type show a similar story - urban cities see the largest total amount of fares, while rural cities see the lowest. All three city types show a spike in total fares at the end of February, while all cities had their lowest fare totals at the beginning of January. Suburban cities are showing a sharp increase in total fares at the end of the graph, nearing May.

## Summary

The disparity in fare averages correlates with the total rides and drivers; the higher the average fares, the lower the number of rides and drivers. Focusing on a way to lower fare averages may help encourage more residents in rural and suburban areas to take rides with Pyber. Additionally, the lower number of drivers in rural and suburban areas may also contribute to higher fare averages. Increased hiring incentives in rural and suburban areas may encourage more people to become drivers for Pyber and then lower the average fare, resulting in more rides taken. Finally, the high total fares from urban cities mean it would be prudent to allocate resources and hire more drives in urban areas as they are the most lucrative.
